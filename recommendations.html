          &#10077;Dan is an extremely effective developer because his communication skills
          are as strong as his technical ability and he understands the value
          of flexibility and empathy when working in a team. He also has an infectious
          enthusiasm for the craft of software and picks up new languages, patterns,
          and technologies very quickly.&#10078;

          &#10077;Dan is an avid technologist who is always teaching himself new concepts
          and technologies. On a recent Android and API project, he jumped in and
          took over the API work, working directly with client developers to deliver
          an ambitious product. Dan was also instrumental in kicking off an initiative
          to record our internal Tech Talks and share them with the community.
          His presentation on encryption was informative, well-researched, well-rehearsed
          and demonstrated his grasp of a complex subject. Dan is definitely someone
          you want on your team.&#10078;
