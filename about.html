          As a developer I'm experienced working in both greenfield and legacy
          codebases, functional and object-oriented programming styles, building
          RESTful APIs for mobile and web clients, increasing test coverage, and
          shipping performant, readable, maintainable code.

          I'm extremely interested in machine learning, and using data analysis to
          make smarter decisions. I love to learn and am looking forward to growing
          my programming and computer science knowledge in the years to come.

          Away from the keyboard you'll find me doing yoga, playing basketball,
          strumming guitars, fiddling with pianos, reading, and writing (check out
          my blog below).
