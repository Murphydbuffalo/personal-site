# [Dan's Personal Website](http://www.danmurphydev.me)

This is the code for my personal website, [https://www.danmurphydev.me](http://www.danmurphydev.me).

It's a static site hosted on an AWS S3 bucket, and distributed through the AWS Cloudfront CDN.

The website is responsive and cross-browser compatible, so it should look good on any screen size and in any browser!

If something looks amiss add an issue to this repository or drop me a line at `murphydbuffalo@gmail.com`. Thanks!
