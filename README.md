# [Dan's Personal Website](http://www.danmurphy.codes)

This is the code for my personal website, [http://www.danmurphy.codes](http://www.danmurphy.codes).

It's a static site hosted on an AWS S3 bucket, and distributed through the AWS Cloudfront CDN.

The website is responsive and cross-browser compatible, so it should look good on any screen size and in any browser.

If something looks amiss please add an issue to this repository. Thanks!
