            <p>
              As a developer I'm experienced working in both greenfield and legacy
              codebases, functional and object-oriented programming styles, building
              RESTful APIs for mobile and web clients, increasing test coverage, and
              shipping performant, readable, maintainable code.
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm extremely interested in machine learning, and using data analysis to
              make smarter decisions. I love to learn and am looking forward to growing
              my programming and computer science knowledge in the years to come.
            </p>

            <p>
              Away from the keyboard you'll find me doing yoga, playing basketball,
              strumming guitars, fiddling with pianos, reading, and writing (check out
              my blog below).

              &#10077;Dan is an avid technologist who is always teaching himself new concepts
              and technologies. On a recent Android and API project, he jumped in and
              took over the API work, working directly with client developers to deliver
              an ambitious product. Dan was also instrumental in kicking off an initiative
              to record our internal Tech Talks and share them with the community.
              His presentation on encryption was informative, well-researched, well-rehearsed
              and demonstrated his grasp of a complex subject. Dan is definitely someone

              <p>
                At DrugDev I was one of the principal developers of an enterprise solution
                for distributing urgent safety-related notifications to participants
                in clinical trials, including a process to migrate data from the existing
                solution of one of the world's 5 largest pharmaceutical companies to
                the new DrugDev application.
              </p>

              <p>
                Development highlights of this project include:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Enforcing a large and complex set of business rules dictating
                    who should receive these notifications, when they should receive them,
                    and what the recipients should be permitted to do with the letter
                    (read-only, acknowledge receipt, distribute to other users, etc).
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Crafting a solution that lived inside DrugDev's existing 8+ year
                    old Ruby on Rails codebase, which constrained our choice in what
                    technologies and patterns we could apply.

            <div class="content">
              <p>
                At Kitewheel I was a member of a 3, and later 4, person development
                team charged with building out the company's product. We were given
                a large degree of freedom in how we wanted to structure the application,
                what technologies we wanted to use, and what practices we as an engineering
                team would adopt.
              </p>

              <p>
                As a junior member of this team I was able to successfully advocate
                for the use of several impactful best practices including:
                <ul>
                  <li>A robust automated test suite (none existed before my arrival).</li>

                  <li>
                    Replacing MongoDB with PostgreSQL as our persistence layer. Our
                    data was not close to approaching the scale required by a noSQL solution,
                    and we benefitted greatly from the consistency guarantees, ability
                    to make ad hoc queries, and transaction support afforded by a SQL solution.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Use of a security best practices module, Helmet.js, to close gaps
                    in our Node.js server's security features. Unlike a more full-featured
                    web framework such as Rails, our Node and Express.js server was missing
                    key protections such as CSRF tokens, a Content Security Policy,
                    and HSTS.

            <h3>Cryptography in Colors - Understanding Public Key Cryptography</h3>

            <p>
              A math-light explanation of one of the core technologies of the internet:
              public key cryptography. We'll use metaphors from Brit Cruise's amazing
              Art of the Problem video series on YouTube to explore this topic in-depth.

            <h3>Demystifying AI - A Look Inside Machine Learning Algorithms</h3>
            <img src="images/machine_learning_slide.png"></img>

            <p>
              A plain-English definition of machine learning followed by a detailed
              look at how some fundamental ML algorithms are implemented. By the end
              of this talk you'll see that there's nothing mystical about machine learning.

                  From the Coursera course description:
                  <blockquote>
                    "This machine learning class was the class that had started Coursera.
                    I'm excited to be teaching it again. By the time you finish this class,
                    you'll know how to apply the most advanced machine learning algorithms
                    to such problems as anti-spam, image recognition, clustering, building
                    recommender systems, and many other problems. You'll also know how
                    to select the right algorithm for the right job, as well as become
                    expert at 'debugging' and figuring out how to improve a learning algorithm's
                    performance."
