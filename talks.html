              A math-light explanation of one of the core technologies of the internet:
              public key cryptography. We'll use metaphors from Brit Cruise's amazing

              A plain-English definition of machine learning followed by a detailed
              look at how some fundamental ML algorithms are implemented. By the end
              of this talk you'll see that there's nothing mystical about machine learning.
